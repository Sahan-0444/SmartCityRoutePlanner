# Smart City Route Planner ‚Äì CIT300 Graded Practical Assignment 1

## üß† Project Overview
The **Smart City Route Planner** is a console-based system designed to model a city‚Äôs transport network using data structures such as **Graphs**, **Trees**, **Linked Lists**, **Queues**, and **Stacks**. The project allows users to add and remove city locations, connect them with roads, and display all existing connections through a simple menu-driven interface. It demonstrates how real-world relationships, such as city routes, can be represented and managed efficiently using data structures. This project helps visualize how data organization and traversal techniques support smart city concepts and efficient route planning in computer science applications.

## üéØ Objectives
- Represent city locations and roads using a **Graph** (Adjacency List or Adjacency Matrix).
- Manage locations and roads through **Add/Remove** operations.
- Display all connections between locations.
- Use **Queues** or **Stacks** for traversal (BFS/DFS).
- Store location data in a **Tree** or **Linked List** for efficient management.
- Provide a **menu-driven interface** with input validation and clear outputs.
